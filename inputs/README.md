# Input Configurations
This is a placeholder folder to remind users that within Synergos Director, all input metadata will be imported from this directory. To specify your own customizations, mount your own volumes to `"XXX:/orchestrator/inputs"`.

No custom inputs are allowed in the current version, but some of the newer features in subsequent releases will :)
